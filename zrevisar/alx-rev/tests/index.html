<h1>OpenBiblio Test Suite</h1>
<p><strong style="color: red">WARNING:</strong>
These tests modify the database.  <strong>DO NOT</strong> run the
test suite unless you are willing to lose all your data.</p>
<ul>
<li>Unit tests (not in place yet)</li>
<li><a href="selenium/core/TestRunner.html">Functional tests</a>
<p>As useful as these functional tests are, they aren't as robust as they should be.
It's just as likely that failures may indicate errors in the suite as errors in the system.
Also, running the tests many times in succession seems to tickle bugs in both IE and
Firefox, so a browser restart may be necessary.  Look sharp.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Hardcoded path! /openbiblio/database_constants.php points to the target database for the test suite.</li>
    <li>Most tests require that the Install test is run successfully (English language, original test data).</li>
    <li>Repeating a single test may fail because some tests change the test data.</li>
    <li>Make sure the browser does not block pop-ups.</li>
    <li>The Circulation test pops up a secondary window and print dialog. Close it before the Cataloging test starts.</li>
    <li>Recent versions of Firefox run the test suite well.</li>
    <li>Recent versions of Internet Explorer require compatibility mode for the tests (not for normal operation).</li>
    <li>The note below refers to an older version of Internet Explorer.</li>
  </ul>
<p><strong>IE Note:</strong> The Cataloging test seems to trigger some bad interaction
between IE and Selenium.  I haven't fully investigated yet, but running the test normally
almost always results in some sort of 'permission denied' error from IE.  However, running
the test in single-step mode succeeds.</p>
